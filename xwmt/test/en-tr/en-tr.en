The intention would also be to infiltrate terrorists through the waters , IB officials further note .
Officials say that as the latest information available , Pakistan based terrorist camps continue to train cadres for underwater strikes .
While the Balakot camp was reactivated by the Jaish-e-Mohammad , the Lashkar-e-Tayiba to has activated two of its maritime camps at Mirpur and Sialkot .
The incident in which Pakistan used drones to send in arms and ammunition is one such example of how the tactics are changing .
Officials tell OneIndia that terror groups would look to use various techniques as the land is becoming difficult to access owing to the huge security build-up .
It was back in January that the Intelligence had first signalled that Pakistan is urging its terror groups to go ahead with Operation Samudari .
However , over the past couple of weeks , the Indian intelligence has been picking up information about the opening up of the aquatic training centres of both the Lashkar-e-Tayiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad .
New Delhi , Sep 27 : Almost all top terror groups in Pakistan have activated their modules , training camps just to name a few .

" The police are keen to apprehend the alleged abductors so as to bring them to justice and protect the public , " Mutsvangwa said .
Monica Mutsvangwa , Zimbabwe’s Information Minister , maintains police interfered with Magombeyi’s departure for safety and health reasons .
Peter Magombeyi’s departure for South Africa only came after the head of the High Court , George Chiweshe , chastised police who had defied a court order and blocked the doctor from leaving .
" I am very happy for that step taken by the medical practitioners , am very happy on that one , because there are some areas whereby l feel he needs further medication , " Kingstone Magombeyi said .

Earlier this week , Newsom said at a United Nations Climate Summit that he was " humiliated " by Trump’s environmental record .
EIP has found that sources like factory farms and coal ash dumps near power plants are major sources of water pollution and have not faced EPA enforcement .
Eric Schaeffer , director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former top enforcement official at EPA , said the agency’s current focus on homeless encampments is misdirected when it " has done so little to enforce illegal discharges from much larger sources across the US . "
" I would love to have a President that wants to work with us on solutions to the challenges we face , whether that be with our infrastructure , our need for more housing , or helping people exit homelessness . "
" There are no needles washing out to the Bay or Ocean from our sewer system , and there is no relationship between homelessness and water quality in San Francisco , " she said in a statement .
San Francisco Mayor London Breed accused Trump of " taking swipes " at her city for " no reason other than politics .
Wheeler said the state was " failing to meet its obligation required under delegated federal programs " and that he wanted the state to detail how it will respond .
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler’s letter to Governor Gavin Newsom said the governor and the mayors of San Francisco and Los Angeles " do not appear to be acting with urgency " to mitigate the public health risks from " untreated human waste entering nearby waters . "
The issues have ranged from policy disputes to legal challenges around immigration , automobile efficiency and housing .
Typically , the courts will give a defendant one last chance to respond .
According to the legal docs , Lil Wayne was served with the lawsuit but he failed to respond , so the judge issued a default judgment against Weezy .
He said Wayne received the $ 500,000 investment from him but then never performed and also never gave back the cash .
Natan claimed Stenger collaborated with Wayne from the beginning and lied about being a concert promoter .
The legal docs reportedly show Natan claimed he loaned $ 500,000 to a guy named Eric Stenger to promote Weezy shows .
The suit was apparently filed by Natan against Lil Wayne and hip-hop group Migos back in January , in which the investor claimed they were " Ponzi scheme artists " who created shell companies to get money for shows they never actually planned to perform .
According to TMZ , a judge has ordered the rapper to cough up $ 150K for breach of contract and fraud to investor Ramin Natan but it’s a default judgment with the judge having ruled for Natan because Wayne didn’t show .
Lil Wayne is up for about $ 150,000 in charges for allegedly creating fraudulent companies to book fake concerts and it turns out he didn’t even bother to respond to the lawsuit .

Nor do they have implications for the wider economy , " he said .
While the events shook markets , " they neither reflect - nor direct - the stance of monetary policy .
Along with his views on rates , Harker also weighed in on last week’s tumult in the overnight lending , or repo , market that saw short-term rates spike to 10 % and the fed funds rate climb 5 basis points above its target range .
Yet he also noted potential problems with " trade and international developments and the uncertainty they breed . "
He said he views the economy as strong with inflation on its way to the Fed’s 2 % goal .
Harker , a nonvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , spoke nine days after his fellow central bankers voted to cut the Fed’s benchmark interest rate by a quarter , the second reduction this year .
" My own view is that we should hold firm , letting things settle and watching how events play out , " he said in prepared remarks Friday to the Shadow Open Market Committee of economists who monitor Fed activity .
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker thinks interest rates should hold steady as events unfold in what he called a strong economy that also has " clear downside risks . "

The SSS also accused Mr Sowore of disseminating an interview wherein he made utterances termed by the prosecution as " insulting , causing hatred and enmity " to the person of President Muhammadu Buhari .
Mr Sowore , who was arrested on August 3 for planning a protest popularised with the hashtag # RevolutionNow , is facing trial on seven counts for alleged treasonable felony , fraud and cyberstalking .
The Federal High Court had ordered the immediate release of Mr Sowore from prison on Tuesday after ruling that there was no longer a valid reason to continue detaining the respondent .
" Take notice that unless you obey the order of the Federal High Court , Abuja Division delivered on September 24 which ordered you to release the applicant , you will be guilty of contempt of court and will be liable to be committed to prison , " the document read .
A copy of the court order dated September 26 said the SSS must release Mr Sowore as directed by the court or it would be guilty of contempt and liable to be committed to prison .
The court’s warning was also based on an application by Mr Sowore’s lawyers led by senior advocate Femi Falana .
The court gave the warning on Thursday in response to the failure of the SSS to release the detained publisher of Sahara Reporters , Omoyele Sowore .

Turning to one of the key issues before Member States , climate change , he said Somalia which had the longest coastline on the African continent , was already experiencing the effects of rising waters and temperatures .
But Mr. Mohamed said he is confident that with the help of the African Union Mission in Somalia ( AMISOM ) and other partners , his country will regain stability , which was in the interest of the region and the world .
" With the help of our international partners , we are striving to rid ourselves of the last pockets of violent extremism and terrorism , " he said , stressing that the task would not be easy , especially given the " violence , cowardice and opportunistic guerilla tactics of Al Shabab . "
And while he called Somalia " historic " example of reform , resilience and commitment to progress and reconstruction , he cautioned that despite tangible progress , the country still faced many challenges , first and foremost those related to security , on which " everything depends . "
He went on to express his country’s pride after the success of the regional elections in some of the Federated States ahead of the 2021 presidential and legislative elections .
He noted that Somalia played a leading role in the socio-economic development of the Horn of Africa and expressed confidence that cooperation among countries in the region would only strengthen political stability and social and cultural connectivity .

The company also does not ban ads from state-owned media companies .
Facebook , which is more widely used in Hong Kong , does not release the data on such state-backed influence operations .
After being notified by Twitter and conducting its own investigation , Facebook said Monday that it has also removed seven pages , three groups and five accounts , including some portraying protesters as cockroaches and terrorists .
The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns , said the Chinese activity was reported to the FBI , which investigated Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through social media .
The accounts were suspended for violating the social networking platform’s terms of service and " because we think this is not how people can come to Twitter to get informed , " the official said in an interview with The Associated Press .
Both measures are part of what a senior company official portrayed in an interview as a broader effort to curb malicious political activity on a popular platform that has been criticized for enabling election interference around the world and for accepting money for ads that amount to propaganda by state-run media organizations .
The company also said it will ban ads from state-backed media companies , expanding a prohibition it first applied in 2017 to two Russian entities .
Twitter said Monday it has suspended more than 200,000 accounts that it believes were part of a Chinese government influence campaign targeting the protest movement in Hong Kong .

Yemen was rife with " contempt " and " injustice , " Saeed said , adding his brother was treated unfairly by the Huthi rebels who took over the capital in 2014 despite taking no side in Yemen’s conflict .
The athlete was proud of his heritage , his brother said , but competing in a country pushed to the brink of famine by a years-long war between the government and rebels had brought challenges .
Saeed saw his brother just hours before he headed to Morocco , where on September 16 he attempted the dangerous swim to the Spanish enclave .
" He loved life , he detested war , " he told AFP by phone .
" He was looking for a country that would appreciate his talent and recognise his value as a human being and athlete , " his older brother Saeed said .

The Nyandarua County Government has only fenced off various grounds in the constituency which are said to have been set aside for playing fields when the area was being turned into settlement schemes .
Ndaragwa lacks a properly developed public stadium .
Residents of Ndaragwa , being in the extreme north of Nyandarua , seek most services either in Nyahururu town ( Laikipia County ) or Nyeri town in Nyeri County because reaching the County headquarters in Ol Kalou is expensive .
Shamata is in the Ndaragwa Constituency , whose MP , Jeremiah Kioni , once threatened to push for the area to be annexed to the neighbouring Laikipia County .
She finished eighth in 51.56 seconds in a race won by American Valerie Brisco-Hooks in an Olympic record 48.83 .
Shamata is home to Ruth Waithera , the pioneer 400 metres runner who is first Kenya woman to reach an Olympic sprints final , a feat she achieved at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles , USA .
At about 2,800 metres above sea level , the lack of properly developed sports facilities has left a lot of talent to waste away in this rural set-up .
Shamata is the highest settlement area , in terms of altitude , in Nyandarua County and can be ideal for training for budding long distance runners , but only if sports infrastructure is developed .

It says the names of specific individuals may be used where there is a historical or legacy link .
The policy , due to be put before the full council for final approval next month , says new streets should be given a Welsh name " consistent with the local heritage and history of the area . "
There are 17 primary schools and three secondary schools in the city educating 8,500 pupils in Welsh .
Cardiff is not regarded as a traditional stronghold for the language , but the number of Welsh speakers in the capital has more than doubled over the past 40 years .
However , existing street names in residential communities and suburbs of Cardiff will retain their current names .
The council will also make sure existing signs on city centre streets will be in Welsh and English when they are upgraded .
Cardiff council’s cabinet is hoping the move will eventually mean there are as many Welsh street names as English ones in the city and bolster the language .
Language campaigners have welcomed a decision by council leaders in Cardiff to support a plan to give Welsh-only names to new streets in the capital .

The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against Bashir on war crimes and genocide charges in Sudan’s Darfur region but has been unable to prosecute him in The Hague .
" They occur because people can buy weapons , they can buy trucks and because people can buy the tools they need to commit these grave violations , " she added .
" These crimes do not occur in a vacuum and no funds , " said Cynthia Tai , executive director of U.S.-based nonprofit Project Expedite Justice , one of the rights groups supporting the Sudanese victims in the case .
It says BNP was essentially acting as the de-facto central bank for the regime of former president Omar al-Bashir during that period , by allowing it access to financial markets .
This case is different : Rights activists say it’s the first effort to hold the bank criminally responsible for alleged complicity in crimes against humanity , genocide and torture in Sudan between 2002-2008 .
In 2015 , a U.S. judge sentenced the bank to five years of probation and fined it nearly $ 9 billion after it pleaded guilty to violating United States sanctions against not only Sudan , but also Iran and Cuba .
BNP Paribas has been targeted before over its dealings with Sudan .

iHandy describes itself as " one of the world’s largest mobile application developers " and claims to have 180 million active monthly users in over 200 countries .
Buzzfeed has raised concerns about whether Android users can trust the ad and privacy practices of Chinese developers if Google is taking such drastic actions .

Pompeo also called on the Assad government to release thousands of unjustly detained prisoners , including American journalist Austin Tice , who has been missing and presumed held by the government for seven years .
He added that the U.S. would provide an additional $ 4.5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to fund investigations into other instances of suspected Syrian chemical-weapons use .
" This is different in some sense because it was chlorine ... but know that President Trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons , " Pompeo said .
In April 2018 , the U.S. , Britain and France launched airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month .
U.S. officials in May said they’d received reports consistent with a chemical attack in northwest Syria but did not offer a definitive conclusion at the time .
" The Assad regime is responsible for innumerable atrocities some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity , " Pompeo told a news conference .
Pompeo said U.S. officials had determined Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government had used chlorine in the attack on opposition forces in Idlib province on May 19 .
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , speaking on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday , said the United States has concluded the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year .

I would urge anyone who believes they may have information or perhaps may have seen a bicycle or cycling equipment which looked out of place to come forward .
Neither Tony nor his bicycle have been seen since leaving Bridge of Orchy two years ago .
We are determined to provide them with answers and we want to ensure people remain aware that he is missing in case they may have information which could help .
Chief Inspector Drew Sinclair , Clackmannanshire area commander , said : " Our thoughts very much remain with Tony’s family , who have had to endure two years of not knowing where he is or what may have happened to him .
Extensive searches of the area were later carried out , involving mountain rescue , air support , dog teams and civilian volunteers - all to no avail .
He cycled south along the A82 and was last seen at 11.30pm that night outside the Bridge of Orchy Hotel , from where he apparently continued south towards Tyndrum .
Mr Parsons travelled to Fort William by train from his home on Friday , September 29 , 2017 .

The regional health councils’ proposal therefore also includes a measure proposing young medical graduates who haven’t chosen a specialization yet to be recruited more easily as GPs .
By 2025 , 38,000 doctors will have retired ( 45,000 if you include general practitioners ) , causing a shortage that will be further aggravated by the fact that Italian universities are not able to train enough graduates to supply hospitals with specialists .
Italy’s ageing medical workforce is somewhat of a sleeping giant .
Struggling regional governments are calling for those " who reach 40 years of service at 66-67 years and would like to continue working " to do so .
Currently doctors in Italy can retire once they’ve turned 65 or having worked for 40 years .
The proposal is part of a 16-point document to be presented to Italy’s Ministry of Health in the coming days which aims for there to be a " regulatory amendment on age limits for the retirement of medical personnel . "
Short-staffed hospitals across Italy are pushing for the retirement age of the country’s physicians to be extended to the age of 70 in their regions .
Regional health authorities are calling on Italy’s government to allow them to recruit retired doctors and keep those older than 65 working until they’re 70 , as a means of tackling their serious shortages of medical practitioners .

Scharf himself was part of that trend , leaving J.P. Morgan in 2012 to become CEO of credit-card network Visa .
J.P. Morgan has been called a training school for CEOs as Dimon’s deputies have gone on to lead vendors including First Data or European banks such as Barclays or Standard Chartered .
Now , Scharf becomes the first of Dimon’s proteges to take over a direct competitor to J.P. Morgan Chase , the U.S. financial services giant and the world’s most valuable bank by market capitalization .
That helped me mature in business faster .
" I was younger than almost everybody else by 20 years , " Scharf , 54 , told the alumni magazine of NYU Stern’s business school .
That move proved pivotal for Scharf : He quickly became Dimon’s right hand man and followed him for the next 25 years in a series of roles at institutions that reshaped the U.S. banking landscape .
Scharf was a senior at Johns Hopkins University when Dimon hired him at Baltimore lender Commercial Credit .
Three decades before Charlie Scharf was named CEO of Wells Fargo , he got his start by mailing his resume to an up-and-coming banker named Jamie Dimon .

Some investors said the bank’s overhaul did not go far enough .
Outgoing finance chief Stephan Engels added the latest loosening of policy by the European Central Bank " will not make our lives easier , " and that a programme designed to cushion the blow for banks would not fully compensate .
The challenges facing banks are enormous , " Zielke said .
Negative interest rates , increasing regulation , a weaker economy and tough competition .
Commerzbank , part owned by the German government after a bailout , has been struggling for years with a legacy of bad debts , high costs and fines , and tough trading conditions have hampered its recovery efforts .
It came as the bank’s supervisory board approved plans announced last week to cut thousands of staff and close a fifth of branches following a failed merger with bigger rival Deutsche Bank .
The bank’s downgrade was announced late last night .

He suffers from schizophrenia , which is why he was found not criminally responsible , but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication .
It was a violent and unpredictable attack .
De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break .
First , let’s examine the more pessimistic side .
There are two sides to this : one citing his violent behaviour in the past , calling to prevent it from happening again , and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation .
The decision won’t come for a few more weeks , so in the meantime we’re left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea .
Now , in 2019 , there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms , such as unsupervised outings .
In 2016 , Matthew de Grood , the man who killed five people at a house party in Calgary , was found to be not criminally responsible for his actions .

Speaking on the RTÉ Rugby Podcast , Ferris argues that Carty has been the most " consistent " out-half in the Irish system across 2019 - including Johnny Sexton .
A few years back , there was a host of out-half candidates vying for the tag of understudy to Johnny Sexton , and the Athlone-born out-half has emerged from the pack to challenge Joey Carbery for the role .
Carty has been handed his second international start against Japan on Saturday , the first coming in the World Cup warm-up win over Wales in Cardiff late last month .
He has appeared eight times since then , impressing on each occasion , including a delightful performance on being introduced in the second half of Ireland’s demolition of Scotland on Sunday .
The 27-year old Carty only made his international debut in late February , as a late replacement in Ireland’s rather unconvincing victory over Italy in the Six Nations .

The Justice Department later said it was opening a probe of online platforms .
Reuters and others reported in June the two federal agencies had divided up responsibility for the companies being investigated , with the Justice Department taking Google and Apple while the FTC looked at Facebook and Amazon .
Facebook declined to comment on Wednesday .
The company , which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has 2.4 billion monthly users , recently paid a $ 5 billion settlement for sharing 87 million users’ data with defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica .
Facebook has faced extra scrutiny tied to how it allowed its platforms to be used during the 2016 U.S. presidential election .
Large tech companies , including Apple Inc , Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google , have increasingly been on the defensive in recent years over lapses such as privacy breaches and outsized market influence .
Facebook also faces probes by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) , a group of state attorneys general led by New York and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee .
The U.S. Justice Department will open an antitrust investigation of Facebook Inc , a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday , marking the fourth recent antitrust probe of the social media company .

The Mugabe family had said they don’t want anything to do with the heroes acre .
Reacting to the latest development on Mugabe’s burial , Maureen Kademaunga of the Movement for Democratic Change led by Nelson Chamisa , told VOA Zimbabwe Service that the late former president’s burial saga will cost the nation huge sums of money as a mausoleum being built in Harare has been abandoned without proper consultations with relevant stakeholders .
Government will render all the necessary support to give the late former president a fitting burial as led by the family .
In line with government policy to respect the wishes of families of deceased heroes , government is cooperating with the Mugabe family in their new position .

" It is taking a while for agents to get up to speed with pricing and the valuation may not be as reflective as the mood on the ground , " she said .
Ms Conisbee said the price guides and reserves that have been broken by so much is from a combination of factors including limited stock , buyer confidence and real estate agents remaining cautious .
" The inner city and eastern suburbs are seeing the best conditions , with strong search activity that is now flowing through to pricing , while other parts of Sydney remain stable , " she said .
REA chief economist Nerida Conisbee said Sydney is a tale of two cities at the moment and it is causing volatile results .
The mixed market has seen a small but stable growth in price , with CoreLogic August monthly home value index showing a 1.6 per cent increase in house prices .
Since the federal election , record low interest rates and the loosening of lending requirements , the Sydney market has seen plenty of mixed results , with many houses selling for hundred thousands of dollars above the reserve , while others are only just selling .
Experts say that in a market that is seeing the Sydney clearance rate hover around 80 per cent and a lack of stock , buyers need to be patient to avoid having FOMO , the fear-of-missing-out .
House hunters need to have a game plan that they are prepared to obey to combat a turbulent Sydney market that is throwing up plenty of conflicting results .

He pointed to North Korea’s repatriation of American detainees " who committed hostile acts " against the country and the return of remains of soldiers killed during the 1950-53 Korean War .
The Foreign Ministry adviser said North Korea " has made sincere efforts to build trust " and implement the joint Washington-Pyongyang statement issued after the first summit between Kim and Mr Trump in Singapore last year .
While past summits were " historic occasions " for the two leaders " to express their political will to put an end to the hostile relations between the two countries and have peace and stability settled on the Korean peninsula , " Kim Kye Gwan said " no practical follow-up was made to implement the issues agreed upon at the summit talks .

Representatives for both Toyota and Subaru said the news was not something that had been announced by their companies .
Subaru is likely to reciprocate with a stake in Toyota that would roughly equal the value of Toyota’s additional investment , one of the people told Reuters .
Toyota’s investment is likely to cost more than 70 billion yen ( $ 650 million ) based on Subaru’s stock market value , said the Nikkei business daily , which first reported the news .

That is the man who chairs the mighty House Intelligence Committee .
Keep in mind , that isn’t some guy babbling in the men’s room at Starbucks .
" He recently went into a kind of trance and delivered his own prophetic version of what he believed must have happened between President Trump and the president of Ukraine , " said Carlson , who showed a clip of Thursday’s congressional hearing chaired by Schiff .
Then Carlson , who declared that it’s " hard to believe " that Trump’s actions are an impeachable offense , ratcheted up his takedown of the California lawmaker .
Carlson was leading into Schiff’s improvised version of President Donald Trump’s phone call with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky , in which the president repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter as U.S. military aid was temporarily blocked .
This coming from a guy who called white supremacy a hoax .

" Who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information ?
" Basically , that person never saw the report , never saw the call , and he never saw the call - heard something and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is - they’re almost a spy , " Trump said .
The Los Angeles Times posted audio of Trump’s spy remarks he reportedly made in front of a crowd of staff from the United States Mission to the United Nations in New York City .
The White House then attempted to cover up the exchange , according to the complaint .
Biden is a front-runner in the Democratic race to challenge Trump’s reelection in 2020 .
The whistleblower , an unnamed U.S. intelligence officer , alleges several White House officials accused Trump of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter .
The president made the remark as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the complaint , which prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif . ) on Tuesday to announce the opening of an impeachment inquiry into Trump .
President Donald Trump on Thursday attacked anyone involved in the whistleblower complaint regarding his dealings with Ukraine as " almost a spy " and suggested their actions to expose his alleged impropriety were " treason , " reported The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times .

The union’s lead negotiator on the GM contract , Vice President Terry Dittes , sent a letter to the company accusing it of " toying with the lives of hundreds of thousands of our UAW families . "
The UAW did not let up its criticism even after GM reversed course Thursday .
Labor leaders and politicians hammered the company for what appeared to be a hardball bargaining tactic two days into the strike .
That earlier decision by GM ― which turned into national news ― created a wave of anxiety among employees who feared a lapse in coverage .
The move amounts to an about-face by Detroit-based GM , which said last week that the United Auto Workers union would have to fund COBRA benefits until the work stoppage ended .
The company assured there would be " no disruption " to medical , dental and prescription drug coverage .
The automaker said in a statement Thursday that it was " very concerned about the significant confusion " surrounding employee health insurance and that it had " chosen to work with our providers to keep all benefits fully in place " for workers on strike .
General Motors has decided to fund health care benefits for thousands of striking workers after the company initially moved to cut them off early in the nationwide work stoppage .

" Furthermore , sanctions are slowing down our progress , inhibiting our economic recovery and punishing the poorest and most vulnerable , " he said .
These achievements are in spite of the continued albatross of the illegal economic sanctions .
While Zimbabwe had registered significant progress in providing safety nets for vulnerable groups of society , the President said , more could have been achieved had it not been for the illegal sanctions .
He applauded Southern Africa for solidly standing by Zimbabwe in calling for the unconditional removal of the two-decades-old embargo .
The President said this here during his address to the 74th Ordinary Session of the United Nations General Assembly ( UNGA 74 ) .
He further dismissed the embargo as an attack on the rights of citizens .

Some of Morrison’s critics on the left see a world they fear , or perhaps secretly the almighty battle they want , when they make the Prime Minister out to be like Trump .
Trump is divisive in Australia and his friendship with Morrison may alienate some Australian voters , which means copying the President is no guarantee of victory .
Compulsory voting stays the hand of anyone who wants to appeal to the edge and forget the middle .
Those around Morrison are not planning a Trumpification of the Prime Minister for the simple reason that the intensely partisan tactics that work in the United States cannot work in a world where elections are won and lost in the centre .
But political tactics do not transfer so easily across the Pacific .
So when Morrison needs answers on how to win the next election , he will no doubt consider Trump’s formula - and whether it works in November 2020 .
He complained about the media on Wednesday for running " completely false " and " completely misleading " accounts of his climate policies .
And Morrison does not have to say " fake news " to echo the President at times .
Scott Morrison will consider Donald Trump’s formula , but it’s unlikely he’ll follow it
