The intention would also be to infiltrate terrorists through the waters , IB officials further note .
Officials say that as the latest information available , Pakistan based terrorist camps continue to train cadres for underwater strikes .
While the Balakot camp was reactivated by the Jaish-e-Mohammad , the Lashkar-e-Tayiba to has activated two of its maritime camps at Mirpur and Sialkot .
The incident in which Pakistan used drones to send in arms and ammunition is one such example of how the tactics are changing .
Officials tell OneIndia that terror groups would look to use various techniques as the land is becoming difficult to access owing to the huge security build-up .
It was back in January that the Intelligence had first signalled that Pakistan is urging its terror groups to go ahead with Operation Samudari .
However , over the past couple of weeks , the Indian intelligence has been picking up information about the opening up of the aquatic training centres of both the Lashkar-e-Tayiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad .
New Delhi , Sep 27 : Almost all top terror groups in Pakistan have activated their modules , training camps just to name a few .

" The police are keen to apprehend the alleged abductors so as to bring them to justice and protect the public , " Mutsvangwa said .
Monica Mutsvangwa , Zimbabwe’s Information Minister , maintains police interfered with Magombeyi’s departure for safety and health reasons .
Peter Magombeyi’s departure for South Africa only came after the head of the High Court , George Chiweshe , chastised police who had defied a court order and blocked the doctor from leaving .
" I am very happy for that step taken by the medical practitioners , am very happy on that one , because there are some areas whereby l feel he needs further medication , " Kingstone Magombeyi said .

Earlier this week , Newsom said at a United Nations Climate Summit that he was " humiliated " by Trump’s environmental record .
EIP has found that sources like factory farms and coal ash dumps near power plants are major sources of water pollution and have not faced EPA enforcement .
Eric Schaeffer , director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former top enforcement official at EPA , said the agency’s current focus on homeless encampments is misdirected when it " has done so little to enforce illegal discharges from much larger sources across the US . "
" I would love to have a President that wants to work with us on solutions to the challenges we face , whether that be with our infrastructure , our need for more housing , or helping people exit homelessness . "
" There are no needles washing out to the Bay or Ocean from our sewer system , and there is no relationship between homelessness and water quality in San Francisco , " she said in a statement .
San Francisco Mayor London Breed accused Trump of " taking swipes " at her city for " no reason other than politics .
Wheeler said the state was " failing to meet its obligation required under delegated federal programs " and that he wanted the state to detail how it will respond .
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler’s letter to Governor Gavin Newsom said the governor and the mayors of San Francisco and Los Angeles " do not appear to be acting with urgency " to mitigate the public health risks from " untreated human waste entering nearby waters . "
The issues have ranged from policy disputes to legal challenges around immigration , automobile efficiency and housing .
Typically , the courts will give a defendant one last chance to respond .
According to the legal docs , Lil Wayne was served with the lawsuit but he failed to respond , so the judge issued a default judgment against Weezy .
He said Wayne received the $ 500,000 investment from him but then never performed and also never gave back the cash .
Natan claimed Stenger collaborated with Wayne from the beginning and lied about being a concert promoter .
The legal docs reportedly show Natan claimed he loaned $ 500,000 to a guy named Eric Stenger to promote Weezy shows .
The suit was apparently filed by Natan against Lil Wayne and hip-hop group Migos back in January , in which the investor claimed they were " Ponzi scheme artists " who created shell companies to get money for shows they never actually planned to perform .
According to TMZ , a judge has ordered the rapper to cough up $ 150K for breach of contract and fraud to investor Ramin Natan but it’s a default judgment with the judge having ruled for Natan because Wayne didn’t show .
Lil Wayne is up for about $ 150,000 in charges for allegedly creating fraudulent companies to book fake concerts and it turns out he didn’t even bother to respond to the lawsuit .

Nor do they have implications for the wider economy , " he said .
While the events shook markets , " they neither reflect - nor direct - the stance of monetary policy .
Along with his views on rates , Harker also weighed in on last week’s tumult in the overnight lending , or repo , market that saw short-term rates spike to 10 % and the fed funds rate climb 5 basis points above its target range .
Yet he also noted potential problems with " trade and international developments and the uncertainty they breed . "
He said he views the economy as strong with inflation on its way to the Fed’s 2 % goal .
Harker , a nonvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , spoke nine days after his fellow central bankers voted to cut the Fed’s benchmark interest rate by a quarter , the second reduction this year .
" My own view is that we should hold firm , letting things settle and watching how events play out , " he said in prepared remarks Friday to the Shadow Open Market Committee of economists who monitor Fed activity .
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker thinks interest rates should hold steady as events unfold in what he called a strong economy that also has " clear downside risks . "

The SSS also accused Mr Sowore of disseminating an interview wherein he made utterances termed by the prosecution as " insulting , causing hatred and enmity " to the person of President Muhammadu Buhari .
Mr Sowore , who was arrested on August 3 for planning a protest popularised with the hashtag # RevolutionNow , is facing trial on seven counts for alleged treasonable felony , fraud and cyberstalking .
The Federal High Court had ordered the immediate release of Mr Sowore from prison on Tuesday after ruling that there was no longer a valid reason to continue detaining the respondent .
" Take notice that unless you obey the order of the Federal High Court , Abuja Division delivered on September 24 which ordered you to release the applicant , you will be guilty of contempt of court and will be liable to be committed to prison , " the document read .
A copy of the court order dated September 26 said the SSS must release Mr Sowore as directed by the court or it would be guilty of contempt and liable to be committed to prison .
The court’s warning was also based on an application by Mr Sowore’s lawyers led by senior advocate Femi Falana .
The court gave the warning on Thursday in response to the failure of the SSS to release the detained publisher of Sahara Reporters , Omoyele Sowore .

Turning to one of the key issues before Member States , climate change , he said Somalia which had the longest coastline on the African continent , was already experiencing the effects of rising waters and temperatures .
But Mr. Mohamed said he is confident that with the help of the African Union Mission in Somalia ( AMISOM ) and other partners , his country will regain stability , which was in the interest of the region and the world .
" With the help of our international partners , we are striving to rid ourselves of the last pockets of violent extremism and terrorism , " he said , stressing that the task would not be easy , especially given the " violence , cowardice and opportunistic guerilla tactics of Al Shabab . "
And while he called Somalia " historic " example of reform , resilience and commitment to progress and reconstruction , he cautioned that despite tangible progress , the country still faced many challenges , first and foremost those related to security , on which " everything depends . "
He went on to express his country’s pride after the success of the regional elections in some of the Federated States ahead of the 2021 presidential and legislative elections .
He noted that Somalia played a leading role in the socio-economic development of the Horn of Africa and expressed confidence that cooperation among countries in the region would only strengthen political stability and social and cultural connectivity .

The company also does not ban ads from state-owned media companies .
Facebook , which is more widely used in Hong Kong , does not release the data on such state-backed influence operations .
After being notified by Twitter and conducting its own investigation , Facebook said Monday that it has also removed seven pages , three groups and five accounts , including some portraying protesters as cockroaches and terrorists .
The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns , said the Chinese activity was reported to the FBI , which investigated Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through social media .
The accounts were suspended for violating the social networking platform’s terms of service and " because we think this is not how people can come to Twitter to get informed , " the official said in an interview with The Associated Press .
Both measures are part of what a senior company official portrayed in an interview as a broader effort to curb malicious political activity on a popular platform that has been criticized for enabling election interference around the world and for accepting money for ads that amount to propaganda by state-run media organizations .
The company also said it will ban ads from state-backed media companies , expanding a prohibition it first applied in 2017 to two Russian entities .
Twitter said Monday it has suspended more than 200,000 accounts that it believes were part of a Chinese government influence campaign targeting the protest movement in Hong Kong .

Yemen was rife with " contempt " and " injustice , " Saeed said , adding his brother was treated unfairly by the Huthi rebels who took over the capital in 2014 despite taking no side in Yemen’s conflict .
The athlete was proud of his heritage , his brother said , but competing in a country pushed to the brink of famine by a years-long war between the government and rebels had brought challenges .
Saeed saw his brother just hours before he headed to Morocco , where on September 16 he attempted the dangerous swim to the Spanish enclave .
" He loved life , he detested war , " he told AFP by phone .
" He was looking for a country that would appreciate his talent and recognise his value as a human being and athlete , " his older brother Saeed said .

The Nyandarua County Government has only fenced off various grounds in the constituency which are said to have been set aside for playing fields when the area was being turned into settlement schemes .
Ndaragwa lacks a properly developed public stadium .
Residents of Ndaragwa , being in the extreme north of Nyandarua , seek most services either in Nyahururu town ( Laikipia County ) or Nyeri town in Nyeri County because reaching the County headquarters in Ol Kalou is expensive .
Shamata is in the Ndaragwa Constituency , whose MP , Jeremiah Kioni , once threatened to push for the area to be annexed to the neighbouring Laikipia County .
She finished eighth in 51.56 seconds in a race won by American Valerie Brisco-Hooks in an Olympic record 48.83 .
Shamata is home to Ruth Waithera , the pioneer 400 metres runner who is first Kenya woman to reach an Olympic sprints final , a feat she achieved at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles , USA .
At about 2,800 metres above sea level , the lack of properly developed sports facilities has left a lot of talent to waste away in this rural set-up .
Shamata is the highest settlement area , in terms of altitude , in Nyandarua County and can be ideal for training for budding long distance runners , but only if sports infrastructure is developed .

It says the names of specific individuals may be used where there is a historical or legacy link .
The policy , due to be put before the full council for final approval next month , says new streets should be given a Welsh name " consistent with the local heritage and history of the area . "
There are 17 primary schools and three secondary schools in the city educating 8,500 pupils in Welsh .
Cardiff is not regarded as a traditional stronghold for the language , but the number of Welsh speakers in the capital has more than doubled over the past 40 years .
However , existing street names in residential communities and suburbs of Cardiff will retain their current names .
The council will also make sure existing signs on city centre streets will be in Welsh and English when they are upgraded .
Cardiff council’s cabinet is hoping the move will eventually mean there are as many Welsh street names as English ones in the city and bolster the language .
Language campaigners have welcomed a decision by council leaders in Cardiff to support a plan to give Welsh-only names to new streets in the capital .

The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against Bashir on war crimes and genocide charges in Sudan’s Darfur region but has been unable to prosecute him in The Hague .
" They occur because people can buy weapons , they can buy trucks and because people can buy the tools they need to commit these grave violations , " she added .
" These crimes do not occur in a vacuum and no funds , " said Cynthia Tai , executive director of U.S.-based nonprofit Project Expedite Justice , one of the rights groups supporting the Sudanese victims in the case .
It says BNP was essentially acting as the de-facto central bank for the regime of former president Omar al-Bashir during that period , by allowing it access to financial markets .
This case is different : Rights activists say it’s the first effort to hold the bank criminally responsible for alleged complicity in crimes against humanity , genocide and torture in Sudan between 2002-2008 .
In 2015 , a U.S. judge sentenced the bank to five years of probation and fined it nearly $ 9 billion after it pleaded guilty to violating United States sanctions against not only Sudan , but also Iran and Cuba .
BNP Paribas has been targeted before over its dealings with Sudan .

Pompeo also called on the Assad government to release thousands of unjustly detained prisoners , including American journalist Austin Tice , who has been missing and presumed held by the government for seven years .
He added that the U.S. would provide an additional $ 4.5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to fund investigations into other instances of suspected Syrian chemical-weapons use .
" This is different in some sense because it was chlorine ... but know that President Trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons , " Pompeo said .
In April 2018 , the U.S. , Britain and France launched airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month .
U.S. officials in May said they’d received reports consistent with a chemical attack in northwest Syria but did not offer a definitive conclusion at the time .
" The Assad regime is responsible for innumerable atrocities some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity , " Pompeo told a news conference .
Pompeo said U.S. officials had determined Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government had used chlorine in the attack on opposition forces in Idlib province on May 19 .
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , speaking on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday , said the United States has concluded the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year .
