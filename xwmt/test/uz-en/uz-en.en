The intention would also be to infiltrate terrorists through the waters , IB officials further note .
Officials say that as the latest information available , Pakistan based terrorist camps continue to train cadres for underwater strikes .
While the Balakot camp was reactivated by the Jaish-e-Mohammad , the Lashkar-e-Tayiba to has activated two of its maritime camps at Mirpur and Sialkot .
The incident in which Pakistan used drones to send in arms and ammunition is one such example of how the tactics are changing .
Officials tell OneIndia that terror groups would look to use various techniques as the land is becoming difficult to access owing to the huge security build-up .
It was back in January that the Intelligence had first signalled that Pakistan is urging its terror groups to go ahead with Operation Samudari .
However , over the past couple of weeks , the Indian intelligence has been picking up information about the opening up of the aquatic training centres of both the Lashkar-e-Tayiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad .
New Delhi , Sep 27 : Almost all top terror groups in Pakistan have activated their modules , training camps just to name a few .

&quot; The police are keen to apprehend the alleged abductors so as to bring them to justice and protect the public , &quot; Mutsvangwa said .
Monica Mutsvangwa , Zimbabwe &apos;s Information Minister , maintains police interfered with Magombeyi &apos;s departure for safety and health reasons .
Peter Magombeyi &apos;s departure for South Africa only came after the head of the High Court , George Chiweshe , chastised police who had defied a court order and blocked the doctor from leaving .
&quot; I am very happy for that step taken by the medical practitioners , am very happy on that one , because there are some areas whereby l feel he needs further medication , &quot; Kingstone Magombeyi said .
His father , Kingstone Magombeyi , had been staying with him at the hospital since his release last Thursday .
Friends and colleagues suspect he was poisoned during his five-day abduction and now has liver damage .
Dr. Peter Magombeyi , acting president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association , had been receiving care in Harare for a week since his release from captivity .
A doctor in Zimbabwe who was abducted and allegedly tortured for leading a doctors strike left the country late Thursday for what his medical team calls &quot; urgent &quot; treatment in South Africa .

Earlier this week , Newsom said at a United Nations Climate Summit that he was &quot; humiliated &quot; by Trump &apos;s environmental record .
EIP has found that sources like factory farms and coal ash dumps near power plants are major sources of water pollution and have not faced EPA enforcement .
Eric Schaeffer , director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former top enforcement official at EPA , said the agency &apos;s current focus on homeless encampments is misdirected when it &quot; has done so little to enforce illegal discharges from much larger sources across the US . &quot;
&quot; I would love to have a President that wants to work with us on solutions to the challenges we face , whether that be with our infrastructure , our need for more housing , or helping people exit homelessness . &quot;
&quot; There are no needles washing out to the Bay or Ocean from our sewer system , and there is no relationship between homelessness and water quality in San Francisco , &quot; she said in a statement .
San Francisco Mayor London Breed accused Trump of &quot; taking swipes &quot; at her city for &quot; no reason other than politics .
Wheeler said the state was &quot; failing to meet its obligation required under delegated federal programs &quot; and that he wanted the state to detail how it will respond .
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler &apos;s letter to Governor Gavin Newsom said the governor and the mayors of San Francisco and Los Angeles &quot; do not appear to be acting with urgency &quot; to mitigate the public health risks from &quot; untreated human waste entering nearby waters . &quot;
The issues have ranged from policy disputes to legal challenges around immigration , automobile efficiency and housing .
Typically , the courts will give a defendant one last chance to respond .
According to the legal docs , Lil Wayne was served with the lawsuit but he failed to respond , so the judge issued a default judgment against Weezy .
He said Wayne received the $ 500,000 investment from him but then never performed and also never gave back the cash .
Natan claimed Stenger collaborated with Wayne from the beginning and lied about being a concert promoter .
The legal docs reportedly show Natan claimed he loaned $ 500,000 to a guy named Eric Stenger to promote Weezy shows .
The suit was apparently filed by Natan against Lil Wayne and hip-hop group Migos back in January , in which the investor claimed they were &quot; Ponzi scheme artists &quot; who created shell companies to get money for shows they never actually planned to perform .
According to TMZ , a judge has ordered the rapper to cough up $ 150K for breach of contract and fraud to investor Ramin Natan but it &apos;s a default judgment with the judge having ruled for Natan because Wayne didn &apos;t show .
Lil Wayne is up for about $ 150,000 in charges for allegedly creating fraudulent companies to book fake concerts and it turns out he didn &apos;t even bother to respond to the lawsuit .

Nor do they have implications for the wider economy , &quot; he said .
While the events shook markets , &quot; they neither reflect - nor direct - the stance of monetary policy .
Along with his views on rates , Harker also weighed in on last week &apos;s tumult in the overnight lending , or repo , market that saw short-term rates spike to 10 % and the fed funds rate climb 5 basis points above its target range .
Yet he also noted potential problems with &quot; trade and international developments and the uncertainty they breed . &quot;
He said he views the economy as strong with inflation on its way to the Fed &apos;s 2 % goal .
Harker , a nonvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , spoke nine days after his fellow central bankers voted to cut the Fed &apos;s benchmark interest rate by a quarter , the second reduction this year .
&quot; My own view is that we should hold firm , letting things settle and watching how events play out , &quot; he said in prepared remarks Friday to the Shadow Open Market Committee of economists who monitor Fed activity .
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker thinks interest rates should hold steady as events unfold in what he called a strong economy that also has &quot; clear downside risks . &quot;

The SSS also accused Mr Sowore of disseminating an interview wherein he made utterances termed by the prosecution as &quot; insulting , causing hatred and enmity &quot; to the person of President Muhammadu Buhari .
Mr Sowore , who was arrested on August 3 for planning a protest popularised with the hashtag # RevolutionNow , is facing trial on seven counts for alleged treasonable felony , fraud and cyberstalking .
The Federal High Court had ordered the immediate release of Mr Sowore from prison on Tuesday after ruling that there was no longer a valid reason to continue detaining the respondent .
&quot; Take notice that unless you obey the order of the Federal High Court , Abuja Division delivered on September 24 which ordered you to release the applicant , you will be guilty of contempt of court and will be liable to be committed to prison , &quot; the document read .
A copy of the court order dated September 26 said the SSS must release Mr Sowore as directed by the court or it would be guilty of contempt and liable to be committed to prison .
The court &apos;s warning was also based on an application by Mr Sowore &apos;s lawyers led by senior advocate Femi Falana .
The court gave the warning on Thursday in response to the failure of the SSS to release the detained publisher of Sahara Reporters , Omoyele Sowore .
The Federal High Court , Abuja Division , has issued a warning that it would order the imprisonment of the Director-General of the State Security Service ( SSS ) , Yusuf Bichi

The CCCC had proposed two separate bans on the grounds that Brislane had used abusive language towards a referee and for &quot; any type of assault of a referee &quot; under Rule 7.2 ( c ) of the official guide .
Former Tipperary hurler Eoin Brislane has been suspended for a total of 16 weeks arising from an incident in Tipp &apos;s Under-15 Arrabawn Hurling Tournament match with Wexford on 31 August .
Assuming that the suspension starts from the issuing of the CHC &apos;s findings on Thursday , Devlin will be ruled out of all involvement with the Tyrone squad until early March , well into the 2020 Allianz League campaign .
Devlin now has the option to go to the GAA &apos;s Central Appeals Committee in an attempt to have his punishment overturned .
Devlin , who works alongside Tyrone boss Mickey Harte , didn &apos;t accept the punishment proposed by the CCCC and chose to request a hearing in front of the CHC , who found the alleged infraction proven .
He was accused of &apos; disruptive conduct not causing the premature termination of a game &apos; , by a supporter .
Croke Park &apos;s Central Hearings Committee ( CHC ) upheld the suspension proposed by the Central Competitions Control Committee ( CCCC ) following incidents during an Under-15 inter-county game between Tyrone and Down on 27 July .

Turning to one of the key issues before Member States , climate change , he said Somalia which had the longest coastline on the African continent , was already experiencing the effects of rising waters and temperatures .
But Mr. Mohamed said he is confident that with the help of the African Union Mission in Somalia ( AMISOM ) and other partners , his country will regain stability , which was in the interest of the region and the world .
&quot; With the help of our international partners , we are striving to rid ourselves of the last pockets of violent extremism and terrorism , &quot; he said , stressing that the task would not be easy , especially given the &quot; violence , cowardice and opportunistic guerilla tactics of Al Shabab . &quot;
And while he called Somalia &quot; historic &quot; example of reform , resilience and commitment to progress and reconstruction , he cautioned that despite tangible progress , the country still faced many challenges , first and foremost those related to security , on which &quot; everything depends . &quot;
He went on to express his country &apos;s pride after the success of the regional elections in some of the Federated States ahead of the 2021 presidential and legislative elections .
He noted that Somalia played a leading role in the socio-economic development of the Horn of Africa and expressed confidence that cooperation among countries in the region would only strengthen political stability and social and cultural connectivity .
Somalia &apos;s progress towards reconstruction was moving ahead , but Mr. Mohamad said &quot; one cannot remain deaf and blind &quot; to pockets of global discontent and the effects of poverty , inequality and unfair globalization .
Somalia is &quot; the perfect example of the success of the multilateral system , &quot; President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed told the UN General Assembly on Thursday , while acknowledging that the Horn of Africa country still needed international and regional support and cooperation , particularly to deal with threats from Al-Shabab .

In the early nineties , the rocky infrastructure was thought to have no religious association .
The archaeology here goes back 8,000 years .
There are other sites that remain un-excavated .

The company also does not ban ads from state-owned media companies .
Facebook , which is more widely used in Hong Kong , does not release the data on such state-backed influence operations .
After being notified by Twitter and conducting its own investigation , Facebook said Monday that it has also removed seven pages , three groups and five accounts , including some portraying protesters as cockroaches and terrorists .
The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns , said the Chinese activity was reported to the FBI , which investigated Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through social media .
The accounts were suspended for violating the social networking platform &apos;s terms of service and &quot; because we think this is not how people can come to Twitter to get informed , &quot; the official said in an interview with The Associated Press .
Both measures are part of what a senior company official portrayed in an interview as a broader effort to curb malicious political activity on a popular platform that has been criticized for enabling election interference around the world and for accepting money for ads that amount to propaganda by state-run media organizations .
The company also said it will ban ads from state-backed media companies , expanding a prohibition it first applied in 2017 to two Russian entities .
Twitter said Monday it has suspended more than 200,000 accounts that it believes were part of a Chinese government influence campaign targeting the protest movement in Hong Kong .

Yemen was rife with &quot; contempt &quot; and &quot; injustice , &quot; Saeed said , adding his brother was treated unfairly by the Huthi rebels who took over the capital in 2014 despite taking no side in Yemen &apos;s conflict .
The athlete was proud of his heritage , his brother said , but competing in a country pushed to the brink of famine by a years-long war between the government and rebels had brought challenges .
Saeed saw his brother just hours before he headed to Morocco , where on September 16 he attempted the dangerous swim to the Spanish enclave .
&quot; He loved life , he detested war , &quot; he told AFP by phone .
&quot; He was looking for a country that would appreciate his talent and recognise his value as a human being and athlete , &quot; his older brother Saeed said .
His family in Yemen &apos;s rebel-held capital Sanaa was expected on Friday to bury the 2011 Yemen Kung Fu champion , who had also racked up a series of medals from Asian and Arab championships .

The Nyandarua County Government has only fenced off various grounds in the constituency which are said to have been set aside for playing fields when the area was being turned into settlement schemes .
Ndaragwa lacks a properly developed public stadium .
Residents of Ndaragwa , being in the extreme north of Nyandarua , seek most services either in Nyahururu town ( Laikipia County ) or Nyeri town in Nyeri County because reaching the County headquarters in Ol Kalou is expensive .
Shamata is in the Ndaragwa Constituency , whose MP , Jeremiah Kioni , once threatened to push for the area to be annexed to the neighbouring Laikipia County .
She finished eighth in 51.56 seconds in a race won by American Valerie Brisco-Hooks in an Olympic record 48.83 .
Shamata is home to Ruth Waithera , the pioneer 400 metres runner who is first Kenya woman to reach an Olympic sprints final , a feat she achieved at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles , USA .
At about 2,800 metres above sea level , the lack of properly developed sports facilities has left a lot of talent to waste away in this rural set-up .
Shamata is the highest settlement area , in terms of altitude , in Nyandarua County and can be ideal for training for budding long distance runners , but only if sports infrastructure is developed .

It says the names of specific individuals may be used where there is a historical or legacy link .
The policy , due to be put before the full council for final approval next month , says new streets should be given a Welsh name &quot; consistent with the local heritage and history of the area . &quot;
There are 17 primary schools and three secondary schools in the city educating 8,500 pupils in Welsh .
Cardiff is not regarded as a traditional stronghold for the language , but the number of Welsh speakers in the capital has more than doubled over the past 40 years .
However , existing street names in residential communities and suburbs of Cardiff will retain their current names .
The council will also make sure existing signs on city centre streets will be in Welsh and English when they are upgraded .
Cardiff council &apos;s cabinet is hoping the move will eventually mean there are as many Welsh street names as English ones in the city and bolster the language .
Language campaigners have welcomed a decision by council leaders in Cardiff to support a plan to give Welsh-only names to new streets in the capital .

&quot; They occur because people can buy weapons , they can buy trucks and because people can buy the tools they need to commit these grave violations , &quot; she added .
&quot; These crimes do not occur in a vacuum and no funds , &quot; said Cynthia Tai , executive director of U.S.-based nonprofit Project Expedite Justice , one of the rights groups supporting the Sudanese victims in the case .
It says BNP was essentially acting as the de-facto central bank for the regime of former president Omar al-Bashir during that period , by allowing it access to financial markets .
This case is different : Rights activists say it &apos;s the first effort to hold the bank criminally responsible for alleged complicity in crimes against humanity , genocide and torture in Sudan between 2002-2008 .
In 2015 , a U.S. judge sentenced the bank to five years of probation and fined it nearly $ 9 billion after it pleaded guilty to violating United States sanctions against not only Sudan , but also Iran and Cuba .
BNP Paribas has been targeted before over its dealings with Sudan .
Sudanese victims of war crimes Thursday filed a criminal complaint against French bank BNP Paribas for alleged complicity in human rights abuses committed by Sudan &apos;s regime .

iHandy created a popular range of emoji apps that have also been removed from the Google Play Store .
iHandy describes itself as &quot; one of the world &apos;s largest mobile application developers &quot; and claims to have 180 million active monthly users in over 200 countries .
Buzzfeed has raised concerns about whether Android users can trust the ad and privacy practices of Chinese developers if Google is taking such drastic actions .
This is the third time in recent months that Google has removed lots of apps from a major Chinese developer .
According to Buzzfeed , Google removed the apps from the Play store last week but won &apos;t comment on why it has taken action against iHandy despite Buzzfeed asking several times .
Sweet Camera is just one of the many apps that has been removed despite being downloaded more than 50 million times .
All the apps belong to Chinese developer iHandy and will still be on your phone if you &apos;ve already downloaded them .
GOOGLE has removed at least 46 Android apps used by millions from its Play store and reportedly won &apos;t say why .
Google bans 46 Android apps made by Chinese firm with 50 MILLION downloads - and it won &apos;t say why
One of them walked up to the driver &apos;s side , and shot Alford .
Three suspects were then seen getting out of that car .
Security video , which has never been released , showed Alford stopped in the drive-thru when a second car pulled up behind him .
&quot; Somebody knows something , they need to say something , &quot; he said .
He said he wanted to call attention to his son &apos;s unsolved murder .
Alford came back to the scene of the crime exactly one year after his son , Guy Alford III , was gunned down at a Jack In The Box near 52nd and Atlantic .
&quot; I wish I could trade places with you son , I wish I could trade places with you , &quot; Guy Alford , the victim &apos;s father , said .

Pompeo also called on the Assad government to release thousands of unjustly detained prisoners , including American journalist Austin Tice , who has been missing and presumed held by the government for seven years .
He added that the U.S. would provide an additional $ 4.5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to fund investigations into other instances of suspected Syrian chemical-weapons use .
&quot; This is different in some sense because it was chlorine ... but know that President Trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons , &quot; Pompeo said .
In April 2018 , the U.S. , Britain and France launched airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month .
U.S. officials in May said they &apos;d received reports consistent with a chemical attack in northwest Syria but did not offer a definitive conclusion at the time .
&quot; The Assad regime is responsible for innumerable atrocities some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity , &quot; Pompeo told a news conference .
Pompeo said U.S. officials had determined Syrian President Bashar Assad &apos;s government had used chlorine in the attack on opposition forces in Idlib province on May 19 .
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , speaking on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday , said the United States has concluded the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year .

I would urge anyone who believes they may have information or perhaps may have seen a bicycle or cycling equipment which looked out of place to come forward .
Neither Tony nor his bicycle have been seen since leaving Bridge of Orchy two years ago .
We are determined to provide them with answers and we want to ensure people remain aware that he is missing in case they may have information which could help .
Chief Inspector Drew Sinclair , Clackmannanshire area commander , said : &quot; Our thoughts very much remain with Tony &apos;s family , who have had to endure two years of not knowing where he is or what may have happened to him .
Extensive searches of the area were later carried out , involving mountain rescue , air support , dog teams and civilian volunteers - all to no avail .
He cycled south along the A82 and was last seen at 11.30pm that night outside the Bridge of Orchy Hotel , from where he apparently continued south towards Tyndrum .
Mr Parsons travelled to Fort William by train from his home on Friday , September 29 , 2017 .
Police have issued a renewed appeal in their search for missing man Tony Parsons ( 65 ) , from Tillcoultry , who was last seen two years ago this weekend .

The regional health councils &apos; proposal therefore also includes a measure proposing young medical graduates who haven &apos;t chosen a specialization yet to be recruited more easily as GPs .
By 2025 , 38,000 doctors will have retired ( 45,000 if you include general practitioners ) , causing a shortage that will be further aggravated by the fact that Italian universities are not able to train enough graduates to supply hospitals with specialists .
Italy &apos;s ageing medical workforce is somewhat of a sleeping giant .
Struggling regional governments are calling for those &quot; who reach 40 years of service at 66-67 years and would like to continue working &quot; to do so .
Currently doctors in Italy can retire once they &apos;ve turned 65 or having worked for 40 years .
The proposal is part of a 16-point document to be presented to Italy &apos;s Ministry of Health in the coming days which aims for there to be a &quot; regulatory amendment on age limits for the retirement of medical personnel . &quot;
Short-staffed hospitals across Italy are pushing for the retirement age of the country &apos;s physicians to be extended to the age of 70 in their regions .
Regional health authorities are calling on Italy &apos;s government to allow them to recruit retired doctors and keep those older than 65 working until they &apos;re 70 , as a means of tackling their serious shortages of medical practitioners .

Scharf himself was part of that trend , leaving J.P. Morgan in 2012 to become CEO of credit-card network Visa .
J.P. Morgan has been called a training school for CEOs as Dimon &apos;s deputies have gone on to lead vendors including First Data or European banks such as Barclays or Standard Chartered .
Now , Scharf becomes the first of Dimon &apos;s proteges to take over a direct competitor to J.P. Morgan Chase , the U.S. financial services giant and the world &apos;s most valuable bank by market capitalization .
That helped me mature in business faster .
&quot; I was younger than almost everybody else by 20 years , &quot; Scharf , 54 , told the alumni magazine of NYU Stern &apos;s business school .
That move proved pivotal for Scharf : He quickly became Dimon &apos;s right hand man and followed him for the next 25 years in a series of roles at institutions that reshaped the U.S. banking landscape .
Scharf was a senior at Johns Hopkins University when Dimon hired him at Baltimore lender Commercial Credit .
Three decades before Charlie Scharf was named CEO of Wells Fargo , he got his start by mailing his resume to an up-and-coming banker named Jamie Dimon .

Some investors said the bank &apos;s overhaul did not go far enough .
Outgoing finance chief Stephan Engels added the latest loosening of policy by the European Central Bank &quot; will not make our lives easier , &quot; and that a programme designed to cushion the blow for banks would not fully compensate .
The challenges facing banks are enormous , &quot; Zielke said .
Negative interest rates , increasing regulation , a weaker economy and tough competition .
Commerzbank , part owned by the German government after a bailout , has been struggling for years with a legacy of bad debts , high costs and fines , and tough trading conditions have hampered its recovery efforts .
It came as the bank &apos;s supervisory board approved plans announced last week to cut thousands of staff and close a fifth of branches following a failed merger with bigger rival Deutsche Bank .
The bank &apos;s downgrade was announced late last night .
The challenges facing banks are &quot; enormous , &quot; Commerzbank chief executive Martin Zielke said today , after the German lender said it no longer expected a rise in underlying revenues this year .

He suffers from schizophrenia , which is why he was found not criminally responsible , but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication .
It was a violent and unpredictable attack .
De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break .
First , let &apos;s examine the more pessimistic side .
There are two sides to this : one citing his violent behaviour in the past , calling to prevent it from happening again , and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation .
The decision won &apos;t come for a few more weeks , so in the meantime we &apos;re left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea .
Now , in 2019 , there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms , such as unsupervised outings .
In 2016 , Matthew de Grood , the man who killed five people at a house party in Calgary , was found to be not criminally responsible for his actions .
Matt de Grood shouldn &apos;t be punished because of schizophrenia stigma

Speaking on the RTÉ Rugby Podcast , Ferris argues that Carty has been the most &quot; consistent &quot; out-half in the Irish system across 2019 - including Johnny Sexton .
A few years back , there was a host of out-half candidates vying for the tag of understudy to Johnny Sexton , and the Athlone-born out-half has emerged from the pack to challenge Joey Carbery for the role .
Carty has been handed his second international start against Japan on Saturday , the first coming in the World Cup warm-up win over Wales in Cardiff late last month .
He has appeared eight times since then , impressing on each occasion , including a delightful performance on being introduced in the second half of Ireland &apos;s demolition of Scotland on Sunday .
The 27-year old Carty only made his international debut in late February , as a late replacement in Ireland &apos;s rather unconvincing victory over Italy in the Six Nations .
Stephen Ferris says Jack Carty &apos;s selection against Japan is a reward for his consistency of performance over the past year with both Connacht and Ireland .
Carty is most consistent Irish out-half in 2019

The comments caused a stir in Pakistani media , where cricket gossip is widely reported .
I was disappointed because I loved every second of that job .
Misbah will do a good job , Misbah is a good guy and Pakistan cricket made their decision .
Arthur refused to speak ill of Misbah in the interview .
&quot; And it just happened to be that Misbah was on the committee that didn &apos;t renew our contracts and becomes this heir-apparent , &quot; he added .
&quot; I guess the only disappointment I have out of the whole lot is that there were some people I really trusted who ultimately didn &apos;t follow through , &quot; said Arthur during the interview .
Arthur said he had supported the participation of both Wasim and Misbah on the committee but was disappointed with the decision after placing his trust in them .
The committee decided against renewing Arthur &apos;s contract , which paved the way for Misbah to be named the country &apos;s chief selector and new head coach .

The source added that the other opposition parties , and the 34 independent MPs , would have to come round to backing Corbyn , if they want to be certain of avoiding a no deal Brexit .
Whether people like it or not , the temporary prime minister has to be Corbyn .
Trying to find a compromise candidate , a national unity candidate , is too complicated , especially in the time we have .
The convention is absolutely clear that it is the leader of the opposition - in this case Jeremy Corbyn - who should become prime minister in those circumstances .
&quot; It is increasingly clear that we will have to install a new prime minister via a vote of no confidence , so that we can request a delay to Brexit and hold an election , &quot; a source told ITV News .
A new PM could then approach Brussells to agree an extension to Article 50 before calling a general election .
The Nationalists are concerned there is little time left to agree a compromise candidate among opposition parties to replace Boris Johnson , if he were to be forced from office by a vote of no confidence .

For the investigation , Which ? analysed 355 tariffs offering renewable electricity tariffs in June 2019 and found 20 suppliers selling 100 per cent renewable electricity tariffs without contracts to buy any renewable electricity .
People can only make informed decisions about where to buy their energy from if firms are more upfront and transparent about their green credentials .
We believe there needs to be greater clarity on how renewable electricity is defined and marketed .
Editor-in-chief , said : &apos; As consumers grow ever-more environmentally-conscious , it &apos;s concerning that some suppliers appear to be &quot; greenwashing &quot; their energy tariffs , which could risk misleading customers . &apos; 
The consumer champion is calling on the government department Ofgem to offer greater clarity on how renewable energy is defined as the current system allows suppliers to rely exclusively on REGOs , &quot; greenwash &quot; their tariffs , and do &quot; very little &quot; to support new renewable electricity generation .

The company , which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has 2.4 billion monthly users , recently paid a $ 5 billion settlement for sharing 87 million users &apos; data with defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica .
Facebook has faced extra scrutiny tied to how it allowed its platforms to be used during the 2016 U.S. presidential election .
Large tech companies , including Apple Inc , Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc &apos;s Google , have increasingly been on the defensive in recent years over lapses such as privacy breaches and outsized market influence .
Facebook also faces probes by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) , a group of state attorneys general led by New York and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee .
The U.S. Justice Department will open an antitrust investigation of Facebook Inc , a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday , marking the fourth recent antitrust probe of the social media company .

This is something they were saying from the day he was declared dead .
The Mugabe family had said they don &apos;t want anything to do with the heroes acre .
Reacting to the latest development on Mugabe &apos;s burial , Maureen Kademaunga of the Movement for Democratic Change led by Nelson Chamisa , told VOA Zimbabwe Service that the late former president &apos;s burial saga will cost the nation huge sums of money as a mausoleum being built in Harare has been abandoned without proper consultations with relevant stakeholders .
Government will render all the necessary support to give the late former president a fitting burial as led by the family .
In line with government policy to respect the wishes of families of deceased heroes , government is cooperating with the Mugabe family in their new position .
The family of the later former President R. G. Mugabe has expressed its desire to proceed with his burial in Zvimba .
In an interview , Information Secretary , Nick Mangwana , said the family has a right to designate the burial place of the former Zimbabwean leader , who died of cancer on September 6th in Singapore .
The Zimbabwean government has given the family of the late former president Robert Mugabe a go ahead to bury him in Zvimba communal lands , Mashonaland West , instead of a so-called mausoleum being constructed at the National Heroes Acre .

&quot; It is taking a while for agents to get up to speed with pricing and the valuation may not be as reflective as the mood on the ground , &quot; she said .
Ms Conisbee said the price guides and reserves that have been broken by so much is from a combination of factors including limited stock , buyer confidence and real estate agents remaining cautious .
&quot; The inner city and eastern suburbs are seeing the best conditions , with strong search activity that is now flowing through to pricing , while other parts of Sydney remain stable , &quot; she said .
REA chief economist Nerida Conisbee said Sydney is a tale of two cities at the moment and it is causing volatile results .
The mixed market has seen a small but stable growth in price , with CoreLogic August monthly home value index showing a 1.6 per cent increase in house prices .
Since the federal election , record low interest rates and the loosening of lending requirements , the Sydney market has seen plenty of mixed results , with many houses selling for hundred thousands of dollars above the reserve , while others are only just selling .
Experts say that in a market that is seeing the Sydney clearance rate hover around 80 per cent and a lack of stock , buyers need to be patient to avoid having FOMO , the fear-of-missing-out .
House hunters need to have a game plan that they are prepared to obey to combat a turbulent Sydney market that is throwing up plenty of conflicting results .

And I hope that Scottish Conservatives get the credit they deserve for the hundreds of millions of extra funding that we &apos;re putting into Scottish agriculture which was secured , not by Nicola Sturgeon , but by Scottish Conservatives . &apos;

&quot; However , the US has done nothing for implementing the joint statement , &quot; the North Korean official said .
He pointed to North Korea &apos;s repatriation of American detainees &quot; who committed hostile acts &quot; against the country and the return of remains of soldiers killed during the 1950-53 Korean War .
The Foreign Ministry adviser said North Korea &quot; has made sincere efforts to build trust &quot; and implement the joint Washington-Pyongyang statement issued after the first summit between Kim and Mr Trump in Singapore last year .
While past summits were &quot; historic occasions &quot; for the two leaders &quot; to express their political will to put an end to the hostile relations between the two countries and have peace and stability settled on the Korean peninsula , &quot; Kim Kye Gwan said &quot; no practical follow-up was made to implement the issues agreed upon at the summit talks . &quot;
But he was critical of US inaction since the summits .
&quot; It draws my keen interest that it is highly topical these days in the US to hold another DPRK-US summit , &quot; the adviser said , using the initials of the country &apos;s official name , the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Korea .
A statement from Foreign Ministry adviser Kim Kye Gwan circulated by North Korea &apos;s UN mission came days after Mr Trump said , without elaborating , that another summit meeting with Kim &quot; could happen soon . &quot;
North Korea accused the United States of doing nothing to implement issues agreed on at summits between US President Donald Trump and the country &apos;s leader , Kim Jong-un , but said it is placing hope in the US president &apos;s &quot; wise option and bold decision . &quot;

&quot; Who &apos;s the person who gave the whistleblower the information ?
&quot; Basically , that person never saw the report , never saw the call , and he never saw the call - heard something and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is - they &apos;re almost a spy , &quot; Trump said .
The Los Angeles Times posted audio of Trump &apos;s spy remarks he reportedly made in front of a crowd of staff from the United States Mission to the United Nations in New York City .
The White House then attempted to cover up the exchange , according to the complaint .
Biden is a front-runner in the Democratic race to challenge Trump &apos;s reelection in 2020 .
The whistleblower , an unnamed U.S. intelligence officer , alleges several White House officials accused Trump of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter .
The president made the remark as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the complaint , which prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif . ) on Tuesday to announce the opening of an impeachment inquiry into Trump .
President Donald Trump on Thursday attacked anyone involved in the whistleblower complaint regarding his dealings with Ukraine as &quot; almost a spy &quot; and suggested their actions to expose his alleged impropriety were &quot; treason , &quot; reported The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times .

Saudi Arabia insists Iranian weapons were used and has invited U.N. investigators to assess where the strikes were launched .
Utmost pressure with every tool available should be applied to end the terrorist and aggressive conduct of the Iranian regime .
It is good at nothing but masterminding explosions , destruction and assassinations , not only in our region but also throughout the world , &quot; Al-Assaf said .
We have known that regime for 40 years .
He called the strikes a flagrant violation of international laws and a threat to international peace and security .
&quot; We know very well who stood behind this aggression , &quot; Al-Assaf told the U.N. General Assembly .
Saudi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf again blamed Iran for the Sept . 14 missile and drone attack on Saudi oil facilities , which jolted global oil prices and temporarily knocked out nearly 6 % of daily global crude production .

The union &apos;s lead negotiator on the GM contract , Vice President Terry Dittes , sent a letter to the company accusing it of &quot; toying with the lives of hundreds of thousands of our UAW families . &quot;
The UAW did not let up its criticism even after GM reversed course Thursday .
Labor leaders and politicians hammered the company for what appeared to be a hardball bargaining tactic two days into the strike .
That earlier decision by GM ― which turned into national news ― created a wave of anxiety among employees who feared a lapse in coverage .
The move amounts to an about-face by Detroit-based GM , which said last week that the United Auto Workers union would have to fund COBRA benefits until the work stoppage ended .
The company assured there would be &quot; no disruption &quot; to medical , dental and prescription drug coverage .
The automaker said in a statement Thursday that it was &quot; very concerned about the significant confusion &quot; surrounding employee health insurance and that it had &quot; chosen to work with our providers to keep all benefits fully in place &quot; for workers on strike .
General Motors has decided to fund health care benefits for thousands of striking workers after the company initially moved to cut them off early in the nationwide work stoppage .

A lot of people say we don &apos;t have a Constitution , well , we do .
It all goes back to one fundamental thing , this wonderful thing that we have in this country - that is our Constitution .
Bob continued : &quot; The reason for that , the fundamental reason for that , is that they are defying the people of this country who are sovereign . &quot;
They &apos;re getting more and more outspoken and frustrated because they are beginning to realise they are fundamentally wrong .
It &apos;s not that they want a deal for Brexit , they just don &apos;t want Brexit .
Phoning in Mike Graham &apos;s show on talkRADIO , Bob said : &quot; I think it &apos;s a watershed moment because the Brexit blockers in Parliament are beginning to show their true colours . &quot;
Members of Parliament have been engaged in a bitter battle with Boris Johnson and his Cabinet in an attempt to make sure Britain does not leave the European Union without an official agreement .

Swami Vivekananada had given the message of harmony and peace to the Parliament of Religions , and not dissension .
&quot; The lack of unanimity amongst us on the issue of terrorism dents those very principles that are the basis for the creation of the UN , &quot; PM Modi remarked .
This was his second address to the General Debate at the UN , five years after his maiden speech as Prime Minister in 2014 .
When we raise our voice against terror , it is with seriousness and anger , &quot; said the Prime Minister in a 20-minute speech in Hindi , in which he also spoke about India &apos;s fight against global warming and its development initiatives .
We belong to a country that has given the world Buddh ( Buddha &apos;s message of peace ) , not &apos; Yuddh &apos; ( war ) .
Without naming Pakistan , PM Modi said there needed to be more anger globally about what terrorism was doing to humanity .
&quot; For the sake of humanity , the world has to unite against terror , &quot; PM Modi said in his address .
Prime Minister Narendra Modi , addressing the UN General Assembly today , stressed that the international community needs to unite against terror and work on consensus on fighting terrorism , which , he said , is among the biggest challenges not for any single country but for the entire world .

&quot; Furthermore , sanctions are slowing down our progress , inhibiting our economic recovery and punishing the poorest and most vulnerable , &quot; he said .
These achievements are in spite of the continued albatross of the illegal economic sanctions .
While Zimbabwe had registered significant progress in providing safety nets for vulnerable groups of society , the President said , more could have been achieved had it not been for the illegal sanctions .
He applauded Southern Africa for solidly standing by Zimbabwe in calling for the unconditional removal of the two-decades-old embargo .
The President said this here during his address to the 74th Ordinary Session of the United Nations General Assembly ( UNGA 74 ) .
He further dismissed the embargo as an attack on the rights of citizens .
Illegal and ruinous sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by the West have markedly slowed down the country &apos;s development , President Mnangagwa has said .

Some of Morrison &apos;s critics on the left see a world they fear , or perhaps secretly the almighty battle they want , when they make the Prime Minister out to be like Trump .
Trump is divisive in Australia and his friendship with Morrison may alienate some Australian voters , which means copying the President is no guarantee of victory .
Compulsory voting stays the hand of anyone who wants to appeal to the edge and forget the middle .
Those around Morrison are not planning a Trumpification of the Prime Minister for the simple reason that the intensely partisan tactics that work in the United States cannot work in a world where elections are won and lost in the centre .
But political tactics do not transfer so easily across the Pacific .
So when Morrison needs answers on how to win the next election , he will no doubt consider Trump &apos;s formula - and whether it works in November 2020 .
He complained about the media on Wednesday for running &quot; completely false &quot; and &quot; completely misleading &quot; accounts of his climate policies .
And Morrison does not have to say &quot; fake news &quot; to echo the President at times .
Scott Morrison will consider Donald Trump &apos;s formula , but it &apos;s unlikely he &apos;ll follow it
These awards are a small attempt by a group of people in public life - of different and no political persuasions - to shine a spotlight on politicians who argue their case with decency and civility , and are able to engage and work with people across the divides that affect us all . &quot;
As divisions and bitterness mount in the continuing debates around Brexit , we strongly believe that politics has to respond not by mirroring these trends , but by bucking them .
Lord Stewart , announcing the awards , said : &quot; Everyone agrees that politics in the UK is facing a crisis of trust and a crisis of civility .
Boris Johnson has been criticised for the tone of language he has used in the Commons chamber .
To counter the division , the &quot; Civility in Politics &quot; awards were announced on Friday , with the politician of the year to be awarded £ 3,000 to give to charity .
It was marked by threats against MPs and outrage over the language used by the likes of Prime Minister Boris Johnson .
It comes after a divisive week in Westminster following the return of Parliament .
A new awards scheme has been set up to recognise politicians who show courtesy in their work .

Her concerns are rooted in details from the whistleblower &apos;s report , which states that multiple U.S. officials were aware of Trump &apos;s actions , including two ambassadors who spoke directly with Giuliani about the president &apos;s request .
&quot; I am particularly concerned that Department officials might have been aware of or aided Mr. Giuliani in violation of law or regulations against engaging in partisan political activities , &quot; she continued , urging Linick to determine whether Pompeo or any officials under him enabled Giuliani to advance Trump &apos;s political agenda .
&quot; To help ensure that the foreign relations of the United States are carried out in good faith , I request that you investigate these and other circumstances described in the complaint and preserve all relevant records , &quot; Harris , another 2020 presidential contender , wrote .
Giuliani , Trump &apos;s personal lawyer , was part of the effort to influence Ukrainian officials , according to a summary of a conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president , and a related whistleblower complaint .
Harris &apos; written request to Inspector General Steve Linick comes as President Donald Trump is under intense legal scrutiny for pressuring the president of Ukraine to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden , a political rival he may face in the 2020 presidential election .
Sen. Kamala Harris ( D-Calif . ) on Thursday asked the inspector general of the State Department to investigate whether its officials , including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , worked with Rudy Giuliani on any &quot; partisan political activities . &quot;

In a video of the news conference , Indorewala said that her first interview went well , and that she was asked to return for a second interview .
The Council on American-Islamic Relations , which brought the lawsuit on Indorewala &apos;s behalf , held a brief news conference outside Fast Trak &apos;s Falls Church office on Wednesday , when CAIR labeled Fast Trak &quot; a company that disregarded federal law and chose not to hire her because of her faith . &quot;
The CEO , Ramses Gavilondo , disputes her version of events , saying Indorewala decided she did not want the job .
In a lawsuit filed in US District Court on Tuesday , Indorewala said she was &quot; humiliated &quot; by Fast Trak &apos;s CEO mocking her Muslim beliefs .
Now , Indorewala is suing the company , claiming that she was discriminated against because of her religion when she asked to use break time to pray .
So she applied to Fast Trak Management , a small company that bills itself as &quot; the number 1 marketing firm in the Northern Virginia Area . &quot;

The deal is also to ensure &quot; transparent procurement practices , &quot; as well as &quot; free , open , fair , non-discriminatory and predictable regional and international trade and investment . &quot;
&quot; Japan and the EU endeavor to ensure synergies and complementarity between their respective cooperation on connectivity and quality infrastructure with partner third countries and coordinate action , notably in the regions of the Western Balkans , Eastern Europe , Central Asia , Indo-Pacific , as well as in Africa , &quot; the bilateral document states .
&quot; The sea route that leads to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic must be open , &quot; Abe said , emphasizing the deal &apos;s signatories &quot; aim to prevent China-financed projects from dominating EU-Asia transport links .
Since 2013 , China funded the construction of bridges , roads and tunnels across more than 60 countries under its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative , which aims to build a network of land and sea links with Southeast Asia , Central Asia , the Middle East , Europe and Africa .
EU officials have turned to Japan in an apparent move to evade attracting Chinese financing , fearing what they see as China &apos;s dominance in infrastructure building across Eastern Europe , Africa and Asia .
&quot; Whether it be a single road or a single port , when the EU and Japan undertake something , we are able to build sustainable , rules-based connectivity from the Indo-Pacific to the Western Balkans and Africa , &quot; Abe told reporters ahead of the signing ceremony .
The agreement formally seals Japan &apos;s engagement in the new EU-Asia connectivity plan and was signed by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the Europa Connectivity Forum in Brussels on Friday .
The European Union has included Japan in its Asia &quot; connectivity &quot; plan , signing a landmark deal to coordinate transport , energy and digital projects amid concerns over China &apos;s dominance in infrastructure funding .

Kotecha said the research was based on data for almost 8 million live births in England and Wales between 2001 and 2012 .
The latest study , yet to be peer-reviewed or published , will be presented at the European Respiratory Society international congress in Madrid .
A growing body of research has revealed links between different components of air pollution and health issues , including lung problems , heart disease , mental health problems , dementia and low birthweight .
&quot; If you can find out some of the mechanisms you can look at potential interventions , &quot; she added .
&quot; You live where you live and you can &apos;t avoid pollution day in day out , &quot; she said , adding that it was down to policymakers to reduce pollution levels and for researchers to unpick how pollutants affect health .
Dr Sarah Kotecha , a researcher at Cardiff University , said the results were difficult for pregnant women and their families to do much about .
It is not the first study to investigate the link between air pollution and infant mortality , but the study drew particular focus on different pollutants and its analysis at different points in babies &apos; lives .
Babies living in areas with high levels of air pollution have a greater risk of death than those surrounded by cleaner air , a study has found .
Babies exposed to air pollution have greater risk of death
Neither chamber of Congress appears to have the two-thirds majority needed to override the president &apos;s opposition .
He already vetoed a measure to end the emergency declaration in March .
Trump will likely veto the resolution , the sixth time he will have blocked congressional legislation as president .
The Senate already approved the measure in a 54-41 vote , as 11 Republicans joined Democrats in backing it .
Eleven Republicans and one independent supported it .
The Democratic-held chamber passed a resolution to terminate Trump &apos;s action by a 236-174 margin , sending it to the president .
The House voted Friday to block the national emergency declaration President Donald Trump is using to fund his proposed border wall .

Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech had advocated measures to control population while expressing concern over its &quot; explosive growth . &quot;
Like China , India should bring a stringent law , he said .
It not controlled , this ailment will go into the fourth stage and become incurable , &quot; Mr Singh said .
&quot; Rising population has become like a second stage cancer .
He said those opposed to measures for controlling population bring religion into the debate .
Speaking at a seminar on population control , Mr Singh , a hardline leader of the BJP , said it is necessary to enact a stringent law and those who breach it should face punishments like revocation of their voting rights and economic curbs irrespective of their religions .
Union Minister Giriraj Singh on Friday likened India &apos;s burgeoning population to &quot; second stage cancer &quot; and called for a stringent legislation to control it , saying that if not controlled then it will go into the fourth stage and become incurable .

Wins on the field may be few and far between for tier-two nations at the tournament , such as Uruguay &apos;s victory over Fiji in Kamaishi on Wednesday .
That would be a win for us .
For a lot of guys this is a shop window and hopefully some of them can put on a hell of a performance out there and get a contract .
( Against New Zealand ) we have to go out and put out something that we are proud of .
&quot; We &apos;re at the World Cup to play against the best ( and ) ... for this game ( against Italy ) we were definitely not the favorites and that showed on the scoreboard , &quot; Ardron said .
Ardron , one of the few Canadians playing in a top-tier club competition - for New Zealand club Waikato Chiefs in the international Super Rugby competition - recognized his side were unlikely to upset either of the southern hemisphere nations .
The North Americans were beaten 48-7 by Italy in their Pool B opener at Fukuoka Hakatanomori Stadium on Thursday and now face three-times world champions New Zealand on Oct. 2 in Oita before meeting South Africa on Oct. 8 in Kobe .
Canada rugby captain Tyler Ardron is under no illusions of the monumentality of the task facing his side in their next two World Cup fixtures but said it would put his players in the &quot; shop window &quot; and ultimately help improve the team in the long run .
World Cup is shop window that will improve team , says Canada captain

Sunday &apos;s clash at the Tokyo Stadium will likely decide the winner of Pool D , setting up a potential quarter-final against either France or Argentina .
And flanker Aaron Shingler will again provide second-row bench cover for starting locks Jake Ball and Alun Wyn Jones .
There are also further opportunities for prop Wyn Jones and flanker Aaron Wainwright after they made their Rugby World Cup debuts in the Georgia game .
Gatland &apos;s side features nine survivors from Wales &apos; narrow win against the Wallabies last November .
There is one switch among the replacements , with Ospreys centre Owen Watkin taking over from Leigh Halfpenny .
Gatland has placed his faith in the starting XV that secured a 43-14 victory over Georgia four days ago , this despite the knocks suffered by centre Hadleigh Parkes and hooker Ken Owens .
The Wales skipper wins his 130th cap , breaking the previous record held by prop Gethin Jenkins .

The notion would have been unthinkable only a few months ago , with the WeWork brand strongly tied to the flamboyant , freewheeling Israel-born entrepreneur who has said that his company &apos;s mission was to &quot; elevate the world &apos;s consciousness . &quot;
By last weekend , some WeWork directors started to lay the groundwork for Neumann &apos;s departure , according to a source familiar with the seven-member board &apos;s deliberations .
By the time the IPO was pulled , estimates of WeWork &apos;s value had come down as low as $ 10 billion .
At that level , WeWork was the world &apos;s fourth-most valuable private startup , according to data firm CB Insights .
The falling estimates came as a shock to Son , who had plowed more than $ 10 billion into WeWork , the last investment at a $ 47 billion valuation , according to three people familiar with the matter .
Neumann &apos;s downfall came after WeWork &apos;s parent , We Company , spent months preparing for an initial public offering , only to have to postpone its plans last week , as estimates of its value fell by tens of billions of dollars amid investor concerns about its corporate governance under Neumann , 40 , and its ability to generate a profit .
The vote by Neumann , who remains non-executive chairman but gave up majority control of the company he co-founded , was the culmination of a stunning coup to remove him led by his biggest backer , Masayoshi Son , the billionaire CEO of SoftBank Group , the sources said .
When WeWork &apos;s directors voted on Tuesday to oust Adam Neumann as chief executive after a failed attempt to take the office-sharing startup public , Neumann cast his vote against himself , according to three people familiar with the situation .

Hospital staff found signs of trauma on Noah &apos;s body and determined there were issues with his parents &apos; explanation for his cause of death .
He died the following morning , on July 6 .
Noah was rushed by ambulance to a local hospital .
He was never removed from the home and placed in foster care and on the afternoon of July 5 , Noah &apos;s parents called 911 to report that he was drowning in a pool at an apartment complex in the 1200 block of East Avenue S , the L.A. County Sheriff &apos;s Department reports .
Noah had been ordered by a court back in May to be removed from his parents &apos; custody over concerns about abuse .
The two were booked at Palmdale Sheriff &apos;s Station and a search warrant was served at their residence in an attempt to recover any additional evidence related to Noah &apos;s murder .
Jose Cuatro and Ursula Juarez were arrested for the murder of their son , Noah , on September 26 , 2019 , at approximately 8 : 00 a.m. , the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Dept. announced .
LOS ANGELES ( CBSLA ) - The parents of 4-year-old Palmdale boy Noah Cuatro who died in July under suspicious circumstances were arrested Thursday , officials confirmed .

Before joining the custodian bank , he held the top job at Visa Inc ( V.N ) , the world &apos;s largest payment network .
Most recently , Scharf was heading Bank of New York Mellon ( BK.N ) .
Wells Fargo &apos;s board has been shuffled many times since the scandal , with more than half of its independent directors joining the board after 2016 .
Internal and regulatory probes since the scandal have uncovered other issues in each of the bank &apos;s primary businesses , resulting in billions of dollars in fines , penalties and an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve .
Scharf will take charge at a time when the bank is under a regulatory microscope and is working at rebuilding its tarnished reputation following the scandal .
Sloan had said increased pressure from politicians and regulators had become a distraction in running the scandal-plagued bank .
Scharf will take over from interim CEO Allen Parker , who was thrust into the position in March when former CEO Tim Sloan resigned abruptly .
Wells Fargo &amp; Co ( WFC.N ) named banking veteran Charles Scharf as chief executive officer on Friday , the lender &apos;s third CEO since a wide-ranging sales scandal erupted three years ago .

It alleged that this company was &quot; beneficially owned and controlled &quot; by Deepak Talwar in the name of his son , Aditya Talwar .
The proceeds of crime allegedly generated by Deepak Talwar , from kickbacks received in lieu of securing favourable air traffic rights , were integrated in a company Wave Hospitality Private Limited , the agency said .
The lobbyist was deported from Dubai in January and arrested by the agency in a PMLA case booked against him and others .
The agency , with the approval obtained from the authority , will now be able to seize the hotel , a senior official said .
The attachment order , issued by the Enforcement Directorate ( ED ) on March 28 , has been confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( PMLA ) on September 19 , the agency said in a statement .
A special PMLA authority has confirmed the attachment of hotel Holiday Inn , worth over Rs 127 crore , located in the upscale Aerocity area in the national capital in connection with a money laundering case against alleged aviation lobbyist Deepak Talwar , the Enforcement Directorate said on Friday .
Deepak Talwar is currently in judicial custody
The value of Holiday Inn is Rs 127 crore .

Phillips and Bill Haagenson , an administrator at the Lands Department , said it &apos;s difficult to quantify how many visitors are heading for state lands following the agreement .
&quot; And the state has been very open that they &apos;re welcome there , &quot; said Roger Phillips , spokesman for Fish and Game .
The lands have always been open to the public , but state officials say the agreement has increased awareness that they are accessible to hunters , anglers and others .
Most of the money is generated through logging .
Idaho received endowment lands in 1890 when it became a state .
The agreement involves access to about 3,750 square miles ( 9,700 square kilometers ) of Idaho endowment lands .
Fish and Game through fees it collects from hunters and anglers is paying the Lands Department $ 580,000 annually , with about a fourth of that in law enforcement patrols .
The Idaho Department of Lands and Idaho Department of Fish and Game said that both sides are benefiting from the 2018 agreement .
An agreement formalizing public access to state-owned lands has been a good deal for the two Idaho agencies involved as well as hunters , anglers and recreationists , state officials said Thursday .
Khateeb said the kingdom will also ease its strict dress code for foreign women , allowing them to go without the body-shrouding abaya robe that is still mandatory public wear for Saudi women .
Saudi Arabia will open applications for online tourist visas to citizens of 49 countries on Saturday , Bloomberg News quoted Khateeb as saying .
Visitors will be surprised ... by the treasures we have to share -- five UNESCO World Heritage Sites , a vibrant local culture and breathtaking natural beauty .
&quot; Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country , &quot; tourism chief Ahmed al-Khateeb said in a statement .
The announcement comes just two weeks after devastating attacks on Saudi Arabia &apos;s oil infrastructure -- blamed by Washington on Iran -- which roiled global energy markets and raised fears of a wider regional conflict .
Kickstarting tourism is one of the centrepieces of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman &apos;s Vision 2030 reform programme to prepare the biggest Arab economy for a post-oil era .
Saudi Arabia said Friday it will offer tourist visas for the first time , opening up the ultra-conservative kingdom to holidaymakers as part of a push to diversify its economy away from oil .
Visas in Saudi are currently restricted to expat workers , their dependents and Muslim pilgrims .

You might not put on a happy face for a while after the credits roll , but it is so worth the weird dreams that will likely follow .
This is not a comic-book movie and aside from a few hat-tips to Batman lore , it is completely its own beast , and that is precisely why it works so well ; there is no format , there is no convention and there are no rules .
Phoenix gives the performance of the year here , but DeNiro is also at the top of his game once again and his involvement in the project really solidifies the Scorsese-ian undertones that pepper the film .
The balancing act is truly engaging .
Joker is a character study that explores how a mentally ill aspiring stand-up comedian , Arthur Fleck , becomes the homicidal clown we &apos;re familiar with , and the film deftly walks the tightrope of making him a somewhat sympathetic character without pushing this aspect too far .
What transpires on screen is chilling , unnerving , completely compelling , anxiety-inducing , sleep-disturbing , and absolutely brilliant .
Pulling back the curtain on the Joker was a risk , but it &apos;s one that pays off hugely here as Phoenix &apos;s portrayal of the character , who has been played many ways by many actors to varying degrees of success , is unique and if anything , more terrifying , as this story is so grounded in a quasi-reality and the most real-worldly Gotham we &apos;ve seen .
Joaquin Phoenix turns in an Oscar worthy performance as a comic-book villain whose power once lay in his ambiguous mythology , but has now been bolstered in Joker by an unflinching deep dive into his origins .
Joker is chilling , unnerving and absolutely brilliant
With fibre , downloading an entire HD film takes a few minutes .
It means it can take up to an hour to download a single TV episode and uploading files is &quot; incredibly slow . &quot;
Civil servant Tim Figures , who lives in an apartment near the Gherkin tower , said he can access only &quot; basic &quot; broadband services despite lobbying for more than a year for fibre to be installed .
Affected residents have spoken of their frustration at being left with slow internet speeds in the heart of the Square Mile .
Figures from Openreach suggest it has been unable to gain consent from the owners of 848 high-rise buildings - containing 9,941 residential or business premises - in the City alone .
The problem is most acute in the City where complex layers of foreign ownership have made it hard to identify who the freeholders are , resulting in years of costly delay .
Bosses at Openreach , the firm responsible for linking up homes to fibre networks capable of supporting &quot; ultrafast &quot; broadband , say they face huge obstacles in securing so-called &quot; wayleave &quot; agreements that give them the right to enter apartment or office blocks .
Thousands of central London residents are being &quot; locked out &quot; of the quickest broadband by a legal requirement for landlords to give permission before fibre can be installed .

Mr Kovind called upon the scientific community to take calculated risk .
Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan , Principal Scientific Advisor K VijayRaghavan and CSIR Director General Shekhar Mande were also present at the event .
&quot; None of our successes will have any meaning without equal opportunities for our girl-children , &quot; he added .
&quot; When this happens , our scientific achievements will become even more wholesome and more desirable , &quot; the President said .
We have to take the necessary steps to ensure greater participation of girl students and of women in science and technology .
In this context , he said Project Director of Chandrayaan-2 mission M Vanitha and Mission Director Ritu Karidhal have become household names .
In his address on the 78th foundation day celebrations of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research ( CSIR ) , he said achievements in the field of science and technology will become more wholesome and desirable if there is a greater participation of girl students and of women in this area .
President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday said the participation of women in the field of science in the country is far from satisfactory and steps need to be taken to ensure greater involvement of girl students in the area .
No. of women in science field far from satisfactory ; need to increase participation : President Kovind
